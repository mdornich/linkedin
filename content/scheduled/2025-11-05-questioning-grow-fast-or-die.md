Investors are reaching out to understand what I'm doing.

I'm pretty open that I'm not actively fundraising right now. I'd rather spend time on the product and talking with customers than talking with investors and trying to hire people.

But I keep the conversations going. Who knows, I might need to scale beyond what I can do solo.

The advice I keep hearing: "Yeah, but to compete you have to raise money and grow fast."

I'm not buying it.

Here's why: what I'm building doesn't have network effects like a social network. Modern QA teams don't use just one tool - they use many tools to do their job.

The real competition isn't about who grows fastest. It's about who solves the right problem and how well they solve it.

Most of these conversations feel like investor-speak rather than reality.

Then there was the exception.

One lady I talked with gave me valuable advice on differentiation, team (there's no team, it's just me - which is risky for investors), and traction.

That's the conversation that stuck.

Right now, my choice is clear: product + customers over fundraising circuit + hiring scramble.

That doesn't mean I'm anti-fundraising. If I make Bugzy work and can't scale it alone, I'll think about it again.

The 40:40:20 rule keeps me focused - 40% Build, 40% Sell, 20% AI Ops.

Keeping options open without committing to the fundraising treadmill.

What's the best (or worst) investor advice you've received?
