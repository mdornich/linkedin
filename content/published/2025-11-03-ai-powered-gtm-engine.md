After defining my ICP, only 2 of my 30 cold leads actually fit.

I started manually searching for better matches on LinkedIn - scrolling through company pages, checking tech stacks, reading job postings to figure out if they might need QA automation.

Then I realized: this is exactly the kind of research I could automate.

So I built a quick tool using Claude Code and browser automation:

1. Scrape potential leads from LinkedIn
2. Verify them against my ICP criteria
3. Add qualified matches to my CRM

The 20% AI Ops part of the 40:40:20 rule in action.

Here's the honest update: I've found 5-6 leads with it so far. Contacted some. A few weren't actually good fits.

I'm still figuring out the right criteria. Still tuning what "qualified" actually means.

But here's what I know works: I can spend 10 minutes reviewing leads instead of 2 hours searching for them.

The time savings are real. The lead quality? Still learning.

What I'm NOT automating: the outreach itself. That stays manual. Personal. One conversation at a time.

Because here's the thing about founder-led sales - AI can help you find the leads, but you close deals through authentic conversations.

The meta part isn't lost on me: using an AI coding assistant to build the go-to-market engine for an AI product.

It's not perfect. The scraping logic breaks when LinkedIn changes their structure. The ICP criteria keep evolving as I learn more from actual conversations.

But that's the point of the 20% - build tools that make the 40% Sell time more productive, then iterate as you learn.

No $10k/month sales platform. Just Claude Code, browser automation, and figuring it out as I go.

What parts of your GTM have you automated? What parts will you never automate?
